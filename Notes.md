# Working Note:

## Using `git`
- `git commit` after each 'dot section' (e.g. 5 dot 7[ 5.7])
  - (`:wq` to save your file/commit message)
- `git log` to list older commits
- `git commit --allow-empty -m "Message"` to leave yourself a note
  - `"Message"` can be whatever you want
- using branches is a good thing to do when you need it.  We'll cross that bridge when we come to it

## Using Rails
- using `bundle exec rails s` is good muscle memory for when you create rails projects that have dependencies
